Description: Reading and analysis of MPI timestamp logs.
    Fairly detailed timing of MPI programs can be obtained by recording
    timestamps for various categories of events. The pattern of recording
    a timestamp value, a name for the event type, and an arbitrary integer
    datum for the event has been found useful for several analysis.
    This package provides facilities for reading the raw data written
    by such timing, and for organizing the data into other useful formats.
